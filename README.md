# Mini Project Showcase
A collection of small projects that I had created to learn OpenGL, SIMD, and other advanced programming topics

## Particle Physics Engine
A project to learn how to render thousands of particles efficiently in OpenGL
Features include:
- Custom SIMD-optimized vector library ([vector.h](https://github.com/Ne0nWinds/mini_projects/blob/master/particle_physics_engine/vector.h))
- Efficient Memory Allocator ([win32_memory.h](https://github.com/Ne0nWinds/mini_projects/blob/master/particle_physics_engine/win32_memory.c))
- Use of modern OpenGL draw calls ([renderer.c](https://github.com/Ne0nWinds/mini_projects/blob/master/particle_physics_engine/renderer.c#L250))
